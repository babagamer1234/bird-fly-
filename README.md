# Flappy Game (ready for GitHub Pages)

This is a single-file Flappy Bird–style game (index.html) ready to be uploaded to a GitHub repository.
Put the `videoplayback.m4a` file in the same folder (already included in this ZIP if you uploaded it here).

How to publish on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Upload all files from this ZIP to the repo root (`index.html`, `videoplayback.m4a`).
3. Commit and push.
4. In repository Settings → Pages: select branch `main` and folder `/(root)` then Save.
5. Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

Controls:
- Click canvas or press Space to flap.
- Click the red Game Over button to restart.

If the audio doesn't play automatically, click or press Space (browsers block autoplay until interaction).
